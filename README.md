# Automated Reporting Quality Assurance & Validation System

## What this is
A self-initiated Quality Engineering project that simulates a banking-style reporting pipeline and validates reporting accuracy end-to-end.

## Pipeline
1) Ingest raw transactions (CSV → SQLite staging table)
2) Create validated layer (filters invalid records)
3) Generate reporting tables:
   - daily_summary (by date)
   - account_summary (by account)
4) Export reports to CSV
5) Reconcile reporting outputs against validated source data (overall + partition-level)

## QA checks implemented
- Completeness: row counts after ingestion
- Validity: null / negative amount detection
- Integrity: duplicate transaction checks
- Reporting accuracy: reconciliation of sums and counts
  - overall totals
  - by date
  - by account


## Key Features
- Raw transaction ingestion into a staging table
- Data quality validation (nulls, negatives, duplicates)
- Creation of reporting tables:
  - Daily summary (by date)
  - Account summary (by account)
- Automated reconciliation checks:
  - Overall totals
  - Date-level
  - Account-level
- Report export for BI consumption
- Dashboard validation (Power BI)

## QA Techniques Applied
- Data completeness checks
- Business rule validation
- Aggregation validation
- Reconciliation across pipeline layers
- Automation and repeatability
